# SDET Capstone Project

## Project Prompt
You’ve been hired by a start up company to help test their website. The functionality includes a login page and a todo list. They’ve been growing so quickly that they’ve totally neglected quality in exchange for more features. However, with bugs and tech debt rising the company has decided to refocus on quality for the long term and improve customer experience. Use the STLC to help guide you through the testing process.

After pulling the repository down, 
Navigate to the SDET capstone project and open it up with intellij.  

In order to run the test you must first run the application locally.  A link to the todo Application repository:
